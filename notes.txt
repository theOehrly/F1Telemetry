- f1a seems to be the better working trainingdata
- custom trainingdata seems to be a lot faster than standard
- image size for speed: (100, 44) good for large image
                        (50, 22) good for smaller input image
        --> testing required; may don't rescale at all?
            --> don't rescale at all; adjusting textbox size solved issue



- should rewrite videosource from scratch
- use python multiprocessing ?!?
